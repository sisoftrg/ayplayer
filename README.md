Sound player for popular ZX Spectrum formats for AY8910 sound chip on LTP port or with software emulation.

My old nostalgic project. I use it sometimes to relax listening good old music :)

Z80 and AY8910 emulation code partially taken from other ZX emulators (see comments in top of files).
It now uses ALSA to play sounds on Linux and not tested on other systems.
